This webpage was created to practice and showcase bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript habilities.


# CSS PROGRAMMING MILESTONES

- I used bootstrap frontend framework in order to create this landing page.
- I made use of gliphicons and trigger their scale change via CSS hover selector.
- I used the CSS transform property to achieve:
    A) top background yellow and green sections to appear as if their structure wasn't a parallel container to the top and bottom of the screen. As you can see, each section has one horizontal bootstrap container, and then there are two custom made containers that have the same color as the bootstrap container but that are skewed -3 degrees in the Y axis on top, and two more at the bottom of the bootstrap container-. You can see a demonstration in the following GIF (it might need some time to load):

# IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

In the original website I made payment cards to have prices that would fluctuate depending on the hour and whether or not the hypotetical client would ask for therapy on a weekday or a weekend. Those fluctuations were done in PHP. However, in the version I uploaded to pages.github, payment cards have just static prices to showcase the frontend only as the platform does not allow to run PHP. Only html, css and Javascript.

The website features a business that does not exist. It just serves as a landing page. To showcase the habilities specified below.
